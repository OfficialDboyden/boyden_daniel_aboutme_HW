			<h2>About Me!</h2>
			<p>Hi, i’m Daniel Boyden welcome to my website and thank you for visiting. I guess i’ll start with my hobbies and interests.
         well, i enjoy playing video games very much but that isn’t too interesting.
          My more interesting hobbies and/or interests include photography, art, and of course, my education.I love to take pictures and Since i’m such a nice guy i tend to take pictures of my friends and make them look good.
           these pictures normally end up on their social media which makes me very proud. </p>
